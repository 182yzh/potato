I'm Tudou Yang, a six year student from [school of computer science](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/English/Home.htm), [Peking University](https://www.pku.edu.cn/). My research interest includes MLsys and distributed training. 

I am currently working toward my doctoral degree under the supervision of [Professor Wang](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1230/2031.htm), [Professor Luo](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/info/1219/2000.htm), and [Professor Zhou](https://zhou-diyu.github.io/). 

Prior to Peking University, I received my B.S. in computer science in school of computer science and technology [Xidian University](https://www.xidian.edu.cn/)
